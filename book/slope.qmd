Implement slope charts to depict the rate of change between two points. This is particularly useful for illustrating trends and making comparisons between different periods.

## Setup

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(CGPfunctions)
```

## Data preparation

```{r}
newcancer %>%
  filter()
df <- newcancer[1:32, ]

```

## Data visualization

```{r}
newggslopegraph(dataframe = df,
                Times = Year,
                Measurement = Survival,
                Grouping = Type,
                Title = "",
                SubTitle = "",
                LineColor =  c("firebrick", rep("gray",4), "firebrick", rep("gray",2)),
                Caption = NULL)
```
